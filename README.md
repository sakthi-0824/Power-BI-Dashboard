# Analysis of POCSO Cases in India

## Objective:
The objective of this project is to analyze and visualize POCSO case data across India. It aims to identify trends in case registration, disposal, and pendency at the state level. This helps support data-driven decisions for policy and judicial improvements.


## Dataset used
- <a href="https://github.com/sakthi-0824/Power-BI-Dashboard/blob/main/POSCO%20ACT%20in%20India.csv">POSCO ACT Dataset</a>

## Process of the Project

### Data Collection
- Gathered data from official government reports and judicial records related to POCSO cases across various Indian states.

### Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Cleaned the raw data to remove inconsistencies, handled missing values, and structured it for analysis.

### Data Analysis
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand trends in registered, disposed, pending, and exclusive POCSO cases.

### Data Visualization
- Created dashboards and visual representations (bar charts, maps, KPIs) to highlight key insights and state-wise comparisons.

### Insight Generation & Reporting
- Interpreted visual data to identify critical trends, such as high pendency rates or efficient states, and provided recommendations for action.

### DAX Function
- use a DAX function to find a pending cases to calculate registered cases - disposed cases to find pending case in POSCO ACT

## Project Insights:

- High Pendency Rate: Over 45% of POCSO cases remain pending, indicating delays in judicial processes across many states.

- Regional Disparities: States like Uttar Pradesh and Maharashtra report the highest number of registered cases, showing concentrated regions of concern.

- Low Exclusive Case Count: Very few cases (less than 1%) are registered exclusively under the POCSO Act, often bundled with other IPC sections.

- Disposal Efficiency Gaps: Some states show high registration but poor disposal rates, suggesting the need for stronger judicial infrastructure and faster case handling.
